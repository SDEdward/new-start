- Use **`snake_case`** for most variable and file names.
- Prefix **program folders** with an underscore (`_`) so they appear first in file explorer.
- Add your files and folders to `.gitignore` if they shouldn't be tracked.
- Place the **complete build of your program** in the `release/` folder at the root of the project.
- If you're familiar with GitHub Actions, feel free to add your program to the workflow. If you dont know how I'll do it!
